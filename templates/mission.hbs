          My vision is to have the organization start by partnering with 15 schools in the Burlington/Camden County
          area.
          We will implement a school club within these 15 schools, appoint a teacher to supervise, and instruct the
          school
          to allow this club to be “student-run”.

          This means that the teacher is only present to supervise and the
          students are in charge of all the meetings, events, and anything else that the club may require. “Even with
          all
          the challenges, youth-led organizations are powerful models for youth empowerment and organizational and
          community development” (Young Wisdom Project, 2004).
